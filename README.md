Final Project - Diploma in Network Engineering

# Rebuild the Network Infrastructure of Visual Architect Company

###  Objective of this Project
This project focuses on redesigning and rebuilding the network infrastructure of **Visual Architect and Web Development PVT LTD**, a company that rapidly scaled to 600+ employees across three floors. The goal was to modernize the company’s network environment to be secure, scalable, high-performing, and reliable — solving present issues and preparing for future growth.

###  Key Learning Areas and Skills Demonstrated

- **Network Architecture Design**  
  Implemented a modular, hierarchical network model (Core, Distribution, Access) for high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Advanced Routing & Switching**  
  Configured:
  - VLANs, STP, VTP
  - HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
  - EIGRP for dynamic routing
  - ACLs and NAT
  - DHCP servers with defined IP scopes
  - SSH (Remote Access)

- **Departmental Network Segmentation**  
  Used VLANs to separate traffic per department, improving performance and security.

- **Wireless Coverage Planning**  
  Designed Wi-Fi heatmaps to optimize AP placement using Cisco Catalyst 9120AX with support for Wi-Fi 6.

- **Redundancy & High Availability**  
  Used redundant ISP connections, power supplies, UPS units, and dual server infrastructure to ensure 24/7 uptime.

- **Security Measures**  
  Implemented Cisco Firewalls, SSH, biometric access control, port security, and ACL segmentation.

- **Enterprise Hardware Integration**  
  Deployed and configured:
  - Cisco UCS B200 M6 Blade Servers
  - Cisco Catalyst switches (9300, 9500, 9400)
  - Cisco Firepower firewalls
  - IP Phones, CCTV, Fingerprint Machines
